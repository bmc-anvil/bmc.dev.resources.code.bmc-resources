# Adapter Shared

Contains:

- Config, errors, events, constants, utils used across adapters.

Purpose:

- Avoid duplication of adapter-only cross-cutting concerns.

Guidance:

- Do:
    - Keep focused on adapter layer reuse.
    - Document ownership and import rules.
- Donâ€™t:
    - Import from domain/application shared code from here.
    - Turn this into a dumping ground for unrelated code.
