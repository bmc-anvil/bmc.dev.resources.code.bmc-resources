# Application Models

Contains:

- Command and query models used by use cases.

Purpose:

- Represent intent at the application boundary in a transport-agnostic way.

Guidance:

- Do:
    - Keep models minimal and semantic.
    - Separate command vs query concerns.
- Donâ€™t:
    - Add framework annotations.
