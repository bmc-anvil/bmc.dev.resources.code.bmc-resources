# Domain Driven Design / Clean Architecture / Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)

## What this is

This is a standardized structure to use as a starting point on new projects that want a DDD / Hexagonal / Clean architecture blend.

I have not encountered many folder structures out there that would match what I wanted to achieve, so I created this one.

This was done after reading the classics and a few more modern and to-the-point books like **Davi Vieira**'s _Designing Hexagonal Architecture with
Java: [...]_.

If you are familiar with their work, you'll find a lot of common points in the following structure.

The main goal can be found in **Uncle Bob**'s _Clean Architecture: [...]_ pages, about software easy to understand, maintain, change and extend over
time.
<br>Evolution costs and maintenance costs are at the core of the goal.

This is one of many approaches to clean architecture / DDD / hexagonal that fit my own needs and will evolve as the project evolves.

In the below folder structure you will see covered many possibilities for any application.

## What this is NOT

This structure is by no means a strict approach to any particular strategy or book by E. Evans, R. C. Martin, A. Cockburn, etc... but a blend that
suits my needs the best.

If you are looking for a pure approach to any one of the above strategies, this is not it.

> This is not the best fit for every service in every problem space, using this structure for everything is a mistake.

### Example on "small" deviations:

In this structure `adapters` are grouped by technology and not by context or aggregate, diluting a little the ubiquitous language as described
by Evans.
<br> Have I gone that way, the structure would have gotten out of hands on most projects, so I grouped them inside their corresponding technology
boxes.

You may notice there is no `persistence` in the domain as DDD would suggest, and instead you'll find persistence abstractions on the application layer
and implementation on the adapter layer, closer to ports and adapters approach.
<br> This may generate a bit more anemic domain; I'll see how this evolves
when / if a given domain is shared.

CQS (CQRS) lingo is used, though not strictly adopted as proper full data mutation separation, i.e., true full segregated W/R approach.

### Example on naming blend:

DDD does not have an `adapter` layer, but interface (UI) / infrastructure layer. The `adapter` comes from **_ports and adapters_** (hexagonal
architecture).

`Domain` in DDD is inside the `Core` in HexaArch and is referred to as `entities` within business rules in CleanArch.

# How to modify what "_is not_" to what "_it is_" you want to be

If you read the books or have an AI summarize the books for you, you will be able to determine where I deviated one way or the other.

The below structure and the creation script are made on purpose in a way that you can copy-paste it into an AI prompt and have it modified to your
best liked approach.
<br> It only takes a few seconds, and you already have a starting point in the below structure.

### If you are curious how this structure ranks regarding adherence to industry practices, here is an AI-generated (GPT-5) table analyzing my structure to the different approaches.

# Why

I chose this approach as it was the one offering the most long-term extensibility with the lower effort for my needs, with my knowledge... at this
time...

I've seen at many workplaces how choosing any strategy that fits the company can get out of hands if there is no automated way to replicate it project
over project. <br>
Generating this structure via a script that may be embedded in some build tool guarantees alignment and consistency across the board. It also
unburdens developers / architects / devops / etc. to manually create and replicate a given way of coding.

I've also seen how a free-for-all approach where each dev chooses whatever strategy they consider ok wreaks havoc before long even on small teams.

Devil's advocate on simplicity...

It may be daunting encountering this structure at first sight. However, once you get your bearings and every (applicable) project is configured in
this same way, the complexity (and time / effort...) of moving from one service to the next drops to zero.
