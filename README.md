# BMC code Resources.

This repo is about having code-related resources packaged into a jar and available to download directly too.

The jar file generated by this repository is integrated into the core of the BMC-Anvil project.

# What

You can find here a list of common resources that are the basics of any project, but not the project interest itself.

By the above I mean that a project's interest may be to provide a certain functionality but not to set itself up or to add .gitignore files and rules
and linters.

Every project needs to be set up, though.

A few of these resources are common and are meant to be a starting point in other projects, while others are fixed and will override any change made
elsewhere.

## Resources

| .dockerignore    | file   | docker-ignore rules                                    | may or may not be overwrites destination     |
| checkstyle.xml   | file   | checkstyle file                                        | overwrites destination                       |
| LICENSE          | file   | Common license file                                    | can be overridden by individual repositories |
| mvnw             | file   | Maven wrapper executable script file                   | overwrites destination                       |

### Not to be included in a package:

Anything not included in the above list is of no interest or are files / folders kept for historical / configuration or bookkeeping reasons, i.e.,
[bare_metal_code_style_intellij.xml](bare_metal_code_style_intellij.xml)

`bare_metal_code_style_intellij.xml` are my intellij code-style settings, kept here for easy recovery or sharing if anyone is interested.

# Why

It is the interest of this project and repository to house common resource files, so we have coherence / consistence across the board.

This allows minimizing the manual configuration of every new project.

# How

The idea behind this group of files and folders is to package them in a jar that will be downloaded as any other dependency.

I thought about using maven scm plugin or other techniques to download dependencies and files without having to package all in a jar.<br>
Though it worked ok, it requires constant connectivity for things that may not change often.

Having this packaged in a jar means that once you download it once, it will remain in the local .m2 repository without requiring connectivity at all.

Selected files and folders will be packaged in a jar file for later use by other projects as any other dependency.รง
