# BMC Code Resources.

This repo is about having code-related resources and architectural design resources, packaged into a `maven-plugin` and available to `download directly` too.

The `maven-plugin` generated by this repository is integrated into the core of the BMC-Anvil project parent pom.

Although it has resources I need, it is possible to change the resources and architecture to any other approach and repackage to your liking.

## What

You can find here a list of common resources that are the basics of any project, but not the project interest itself.

By the above I mean that a project's interest may be to provide a certain functionality but not to set itself up or to add .gitignore files and architecture
design scaffolding or linters.

> Every project needs to be set up, though.

A few of these resources are common and are meant to be a starting point in other projects, while others are fixed and will override any change made
locally.

### Architecture Design

Momentarily, only my own approach to **_clean/ddd/hexa_** is present to choose from; in time a few more models will be added.

### Resources

There are two types of resources in this project:

- **Upstream resources**:
    - These resources will overwrite any local changes to always be in sync with any upstream file.
    - Among these are: linters, checkstyle, etc.
    - These resources aim for consistency across projects
- **User resources**:
    - These resources will not overwrite any local changes after first creation, to allow for user changes.
    - Among these are: some ignore files, maven and jvm configuration, workflows, etc.
    - These resources aim for flexibility across projects

### Configuration

> If you are packaging this on your own, modifying resources is just editing two files and adding / removing what you want for your setup.

## Why

It is the interest of this project and repository to house common resource files, so we have coherence / consistency across the board.
<br>Having architectural models also allows for every new project to build on tried patterns.

This allows minimizing the manual configuration of every new project.

The maven-plugin incorporated at the top parent pom allows consistent repeatable projects with almost zero effort.

## How

The idea behind this group of files and folders is to package them in a maven-plugin that will be part of the core pom.xml.

I thought about using maven scm plugin or other techniques to download dependencies and files without having to package all in a jar.
<br> Though it worked ok, it requires constant connectivity for things that may not change often.
<br> I also packaged a few things in its own jar and used dependency management to fetch it. It's fine, a maven plugin ended up being more flexible.

Having this packaged in a jar means that once you download it, it will remain in the local .m2 repository without requiring connectivity at all.

Selected files and folders will be packaged in the plugin jar file for later use by other projects.
